The blaubot as well as the blaubot-android modules are configured to be published to
the jCenter Maven-Repository (https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter).

Requirements:
- there has to be a file local.properties (not in VCS) in the root folder containing the following entries:
    bintray.user=...
    bintray.apikey=...
    bintray.gpg.password=...
    bintray.oss.user=<sonatype user>
    bintray.oss.password<sonatype pw>

How to publish (don't forget to change default LOG_LEVEL):
- cd into root project directory
- ./gradlew clean bintrayUpload

Notes:
- There is an option "dryRun" in the build.gradle file of each module, which allows us to actually build
  the distribution without publishing it. We use it to manually define, what we are going to publish to
  bintray. We can then see the created pom.xml and binaries in the build folder.
- the groupId name is eu.hgross
- artifacts:
    - blaubot
    - blaubot-android
    - blaubot-websockets
    - blaubot-jsr82
