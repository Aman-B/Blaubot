The first beta is now available from jCenter and MavenCentral.
It contains some fixes and stability improvements and an abstract GeoDataBeacon that can be subclassed and used to utilizes the cell connection as beacon technology.

Check out the following classes to play around with it:
<ul>
    <li>eu.hgross.blaubot.geobeacon.GeoBeaconServer (blaubot.jar)</li>
    <li>eu.hgross.blaubot.geobeacon.GeoLocationBeacon (blaubot.jar)</li>
    <li>eu.hgross.blaubot.android.geo.GeoLocationBeaconAndroid (blaubot-android.jar)</li>
</ul>

Apart from that the Blaubot repository is now fully [migrated to GitHub](https://github.com/Blaubot/Blaubot) so you will always find the latest source code there.
Also make sure to check out the official [gitter-channel](/chat.html) for Blaubot to get help or keep in touch with other Blaubot users.
