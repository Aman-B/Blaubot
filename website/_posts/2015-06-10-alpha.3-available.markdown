The third alpha is now available from jCenter and MavenCentral.
Besides the usual optimizations and bugfixes you are now able to prevent re-distribution of messages to sending devices.
To do that, use the new `publish()` methods on the `IBlaubotChannel`.  
Additionally, subscriptions can now be made before any `onConnected()` event happened.
They will be picked up after an `onConnected()` event automatically.
