<b>Paper abstract </b>We provide a method to interactively set up a multi-display using a combination of multi and single device gestures. 
An initial setup provides a coarse grained model. 
Test pictures and user judgement based on the human visual system then guide a fine grained interactive process allowing the user to move and rotate single screens until differences between physical and model position are no longer perceived. 
To this end, a central computer holds the model and connects among all participating smartphones and tablets with different physical dimensions and display resolutions. 
In addition, it evaluates gestures and prepares as well as distributes images on the multi-display.
